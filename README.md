In September 2022 I began to study at the Metalamp school at the link https://www.metalamp.io/education.

The front-end developer tutorial can be found here https://rizzoma.com/topic/d5c429337bcaa70548fb5aeedee6d92b/0_b_8ndo_78h6s/ or https://coda.io/@metalamp/education/front-end-2.

Folder names correspond to job names.
